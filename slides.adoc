== Intro

These are samples slides, they illustrate what presentation slides in Asciidoc
converted to PDF are capable of.

== First Slide of the Presentation

Having slides and student books in asciidoctor have the following benefits:

* You can create slides with asciidoc and share them in GitHub publicly for version control.
* This way your students can access the slides and raise PRs to fix your typos.
* It makes all your presentations consistent.

*You Can Add Subtitles to Your Slides (this is just boldface)*

You can numbered lists:

. First
. Second
. Third

You can highlight text with _italics_ or with *boldface*. You can apply both *_together_* if you like.

== This Slide Contains Two Columns
[.columns-2]

[.column]
----
This is the first column. I enclosed it into a code block to be able to use some basic formatting, such as bulleted and numbered lists. Asciidoc does not render text in code block though, hence bullets won't be a real CCS bullets but just stars.

* You still can use bulleted lists
* Like this
* It does not look very pretty but works pretty fine

1. You can also use numbered lists
2. If you like to

The second column contains some math expressions:

2+2*2â‰ 8
2+2*2=6
